// Serves the purpose of resetting and seeding the database with dummy data for initial testing
// Not following convention from the workshop of quering requests directly to the database with SQL commands
// Instead, creating a seperate commands.sql file that holds the SQL commands, and reading them using the fs package, storing them as a variable, and passing the commands as an argument to the DB query
